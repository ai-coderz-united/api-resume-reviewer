### current issues with responses
1. Although specified in PROMPT, sometimes the model with recommend changes that are potentially non-ethical. Such as changing my job title to `Senior Data Engineer` instead of `Data Engineer` (which was original title on resume).
2. Needs more indepth overview section. Currently just takes the company you want to work for and says "add more xxx specific services"

### next example is a response from a non tech company for application.
#### e.g. title=Software Engineer, company=Carvana

### analysis of response for Carvana
1. Does a better job trying to recommend improvements that are not just tech specific

#### thoughts on improvements
1. We could have the model do some research on the company the applicant wants to apply to
2. We could research sites like glassdoor to get interview experience that could potentially help and be reflected on individuals resume
3. Could build langchain agent specific for this type of task that can run a chain of requests.

  }
}
```

## analysis 
1. this completely breaks the current resume
  - for skills section on my tech resume it recommended words that someone from Uline management would want to see but completely in the wrong context.
  - e.g. ```json 
    "Skills": {
      "recommended_change": "Replace technical skills with skills relevant to a custodian/janitor role such as attention to detail, reliability, physical stamina, and organizational skills.",
      "change_made": {
        "Languages": [
          "Attention to Detail",
          "Reliability"
        ],
        "Frameworks / Libraries": [
          "Physical Stamina",
          "Organizational Skills"
        ],
        "Data Layer": [
          "Time Management",
          "Safety Awareness"
        ]
      }
    }```
    - languages here on my tech resume are programming languages... you get the idea of the rest. 

## improvements
1. could add a field to identify if user is applying for a different/new role than they are currently in.
2. add a validation layer to ensure that if the resume is completely different than the desired job, that the structure of the recommendations change with it.
